# CasaLingua API Endpoint Status

## Summary

This document provides an overview of the status of all API endpoints in the CasaLingua application as of May 6, 2025.

Overall, **11 out of 13** tested endpoints are working correctly. Two endpoints require code fixes to work properly.

## Working Endpoints

### Health Endpoints

| Endpoint | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/health` | ✅ Working | Basic health check with overall system status |
| `/health/detailed` | ✅ Working | Detailed health info for all components |
| `/health/models` | ✅ Working | Health status for all loaded models |
| `/health/database` | ✅ Working | Database connection status |
| `/readiness` | ✅ Working | Kubernetes readiness probe |
| `/liveness` | ✅ Working | Kubernetes liveness probe |

### Core Functionality Endpoints

| Endpoint | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/pipeline/translate` | ✅ Working | Text translation |
| `/translate/batch` | ✅ Working | Batch text translation |
| `/pipeline/detect` | ✅ Working | Language detection |
| `/pipeline/simplify` | ✅ Working | Text simplification |
| `/pipeline/anonymize` | ✅ Working | PII anonymization |

## Endpoints Requiring Fixes

| Endpoint | Status | Issue | Fix Required |
|----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| `/analyze`, `/pipeline/analyze` | ❌ Not Working | Missing `model_id` field in `TextAnalysisRequest` schema | Add `model_id: Optional[str] = None` to `TextAnalysisRequest` definition in `app/api/schemas/analysis.py` |
| `/summarize`, `/pipeline/summarize` | ❌ Not Working | Validation error for `summary` field in response | Fix validation in `process_summarization` method of `UnifiedProcessor` class to ensure summary is a string, not a dictionary |

## Testing Approach

The API endpoints were tested using two testing scripts:

1. `test_api_endpoints.py` - Basic testing of main functionality endpoints
2. `comprehensive_endpoint_test.py` - Comprehensive testing of all endpoints

The tests were executed against a locally running server in a virtual environment, with authentication bypassed for testing purposes.

## Recommendations

1. Fix the two non-working endpoints by implementing the suggested code changes
2. Add additional tests for file upload/download functionality 
3. Implement consistent URL patterns (some endpoints use `/pipeline/` prefix while others don't)
4. Consider adding version prefixes (e.g., `/v1/`) to the API routes
5. Implement better error handling for invalid requests
6. Add rate limiting for production deployment
