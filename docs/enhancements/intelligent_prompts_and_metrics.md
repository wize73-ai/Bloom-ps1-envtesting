# CasaLingua Enhancements: Intelligent Prompts and Metrics Fix

This document describes the enhancements made to CasaLingua's language detection, simplification, and metrics reporting systems.

## Overview

The following enhancements have been implemented:

1. **Language Detection Enhancement**: Added model-specific prompt engineering to improve language detection accuracy, with special handling for difficult-to-detect languages and code-mixed text.

2. **Simplification Enhancement**: Implemented a robust 5-level simplification system with domain-specific strategies for different content types, improving the quality and flexibility of text simplification.

3. **Metrics Reporting Fix**: Addressed issues with veracity and audit score reporting by extending the metrics collector with improved tracking capabilities.

## Language Detection Enhancement

The language detection enhancement introduces model-aware prompt engineering that tailors prompts to specific model capabilities:

- **Model Capability Profiles**: Each model's strengths and weaknesses are considered when forming prompts.
- **Code-Mixed Text Handling**: Improved detection of texts that contain multiple languages.
- **Special Language Features**: Enhanced prompts for languages with special scripts or distinguishing features.
- **Confidence Scoring**: More accurate confidence scores for detected languages.

## Simplification Enhancement

The simplification enhancement introduces a 5-level simplification system:

| Level | Name | Description | Target Audience |
|-------|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Academic | Minimal simplification, preserves academic tone | Graduate students, experts |
| 2 | Standard | Light simplification, maintains sophisticated vocabulary | College-educated readers |
| 3 | Simplified | Moderate simplification, clearer structure | High school level readers |
| 4 | Basic | Substantial simplification, simple vocabulary | Middle school level readers |
| 5 | Elementary | Maximum simplification, very simple language | Elementary school level readers |

Additional features include:

- **Domain-Specific Strategies**: Specialized simplification for legal, medical, technical, financial, and educational content.
- **Grade-Level Targeting**: Options to target specific grade levels for educational content.
- **Parameter Optimization**: Model-specific parameter tuning for best results with each model.

## Metrics Reporting Fix

The metrics reporting enhancements address issues with veracity and audit score reporting:

- **EnhancedMetricsCollector**: Extended metrics collector with improved tracking capabilities.
- **Veracity Metrics**: Comprehensive tracking of quality verification metrics for translations and simplifications.
- **Audit Score Tracking**: Reliable recording and retrieval of audit scores for all operations.
- **Issue Tracking**: Tracking of common issues encountered during veracity verification.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Enhanced API for retrieving aggregated metrics.

## Implementation

The enhancements are implemented in the following files:

- `app/services/models/language_detector_prompt_enhancer.py`: Prompt enhancement for language detection
- `app/services/models/simplifier_prompt_enhancer.py`: 5-level simplification system
- `app/audit/metrics_fix.py`: Enhanced metrics collection with veracity and audit score fixes
- `app/core/enhanced_integrations.py`: Integration module for all enhancements

## Usage

To use the enhanced components, call the setup function from the integration module:

```python
from app.core.enhanced_integrations import setup_enhanced_components

# Setup all enhanced components
setup_status = await setup_enhanced_components()

# Check which components were successfully setup
print(setup_status)
```

Or use individual components:

```python
# Enhanced language detection
from app.core.pipeline.language_detector import LanguageDetector
from app.services.models.language_detector_prompt_enhancer import LanguageDetectorPromptEnhancer

detector = LanguageDetector()
detector.prompt_enhancer = LanguageDetectorPromptEnhancer()
result = await detector.detect_language("Your text here")

# Enhanced simplification
from app.core.pipeline.simplifier import TextSimplifier
from app.services.models.simplifier_prompt_enhancer import SimplifierPromptEnhancer

simplifier = TextSimplifier()
simplifier.prompt_enhancer = SimplifierPromptEnhancer()
simplified_text = await simplifier.simplify_text(
    text="Your complex text here",
    language="en",
    level=3  # 1-5, where 5 is simplest
)

# Enhanced metrics collection
from app.audit.metrics_fix import setup_enhanced_metrics_collector

enhanced_metrics = setup_enhanced_metrics_collector()
```

## Testing

Several test scripts are included to verify the enhancements:

- `scripts/test_metrics_fix.py`: Tests the metrics reporting fixes
- `scripts/test_enhanced_integrations.py`: Tests all enhancements together

Run the tests with:

```bash
python scripts/test_enhanced_integrations.py
```

## Performance Considerations

The enhanced components are designed to have minimal performance impact:

- Language detection enhancement adds ~5-10ms per detection
- Simplification enhancement adds ~10-15ms per simplification
- Metrics collection fix has negligible performance impact

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements include:

- Additional domain-specific simplification strategies
- More sophisticated language detection for rare languages
- Integration with real-time monitoring systems for metrics data
- Support for additional metrics collection backends
