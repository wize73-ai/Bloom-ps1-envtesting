# Changelog: Model Enhancements and Metrics Fixes

## Overview

This update enhances language detection and simplification capabilities with intelligent prompt engineering, and fixes veracity and audit score reporting issues in the metrics system.

## Added

### Language Detection
- Created `language_detector_prompt_enhancer.py` with model-specific language detection capabilities
- Added special handling for code-mixed text detection
- Implemented confidence scoring improvements for ambiguous languages
- Added detection optimization for languages with unique scripts or features

### Simplification
- Created `simplifier_prompt_enhancer.py` with a comprehensive 5-level simplification system:
  - Level 1: Academic (for graduate students and experts)
  - Level 2: Standard (for college-educated readers)
  - Level 3: Simplified (for high school level readers)
  - Level 4: Basic (for middle school level readers)
  - Level 5: Elementary (for elementary school level readers)
- Added domain-specific simplification strategies for legal, medical, technical, financial, and educational content
- Implemented grade-level targeting capabilities for educational content
- Added model-specific parameter optimization

### Metrics and Auditing
- Enhanced `metrics_fix.py` with improved veracity and audit score tracking
- Added `EnhancedMetricsCollector` class with comprehensive reporting capabilities
- Implemented hooks system for pre/post-operation metrics tracking
- Created detailed veracity metrics collection for simplification and translation
- Added audit score recording and reporting functionality

### Integration
- Created `enhanced_integrations.py` for seamless setup of all enhanced components
- Added component verification functionality
- Implemented comprehensive test scripts:
  - `test_metrics_fix.py`: Tests metrics reporting fixes
  - `test_enhanced_integrations.py`: Tests all enhancements together

### Documentation
- Added detailed documentation in `docs/enhancements/intelligent_prompts_and_metrics.md`

## Fixed

### Metrics Reporting
- Fixed issue with veracity scores not being properly reported in metrics
