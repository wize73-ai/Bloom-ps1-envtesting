# API Endpoint Fixes and Improvements

This document outlines the issues identified and fixes implemented to improve the CasaLingua API service.

## Issues Identified

1. **API Route Path Mapping Issues**:
   - Test scripts were looking for endpoints directly at the root path
   - The API implementation had all routes under `/pipeline` prefix
   - This caused tests to fail with 404 "Not Found" errors

2. **Missing Batch Translation Endpoint**:
   - Tests were expecting `/translate/batch` endpoint
   - This endpoint was not implemented in the API

3. **Schema Definition Issues**:
   - `TextAnalysisRequest` didn't have the `analyses` field that test scripts were using
   - This caused 500 Internal Server Error with error message "TextAnalysisRequest object has no attribute 'analyses'"

4. **Translation Quality Assessment Problems**:
   - The translation quality check was too strict for short phrases
   - Simple greetings like "Hello, how are you?" were failing the quality check
   - This caused unnecessary fallback to the MBART model, increasing latency

## Fixes Implemented

1. **API Route Path Mapping**:
   - Modified `main.py` to include pipeline routes both with and without the `/pipeline` prefix
   - This provides backward compatibility with existing test scripts while maintaining API documentation structure

2. **Added Batch Translation Endpoint**:
   - Implemented the missing `/translate/batch` endpoint in `pipeline.py`
   - Supports translating multiple texts in a single API call
   - Maintains compatibility with test scripts

3. **Schema Definition Updates**:
   - Added the `analyses` field to `TextAnalysisRequest` schema
   - Updated the `analyze_text` function to handle both the `analyses` list and the individual include_* flags
   - Ensures backward compatibility with existing code while supporting the test scripts

4. **Translation Quality Assessment**:
   - Modified the quality assessment logic to be less strict on short translations
   - Added special case handling for short input phrases (less than 25 characters)
   - Short phrases now bypass quality checks entirely
   - Only longer content (>30 characters) with very short translations (<2 characters) is considered poor quality
   - This reduces unnecessary model fallbacks and improves performance

## Additional Improvements

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Added more descriptive error messages
   - Improved logging of quality assessment decisions for debugging purposes

2. **Performance**:
   - Reduced unnecessary model fallbacks
   - Optimized the translation flow for short phrases

## GitHub Issues to Create

1. **API Route Path Mapping Inconsistency**:
   - Document the current dual-path approach as a temporary solution
   - Plan for a proper API versioning strategy in the future

2. **Missing API Endpoints**:
   - Review all test scripts and ensure all expected endpoints are implemented
   - Add proper documentation for all endpoints

3. **Translation Quality Assessment Refinement**:
   - Investigate more sophisticated quality assessment techniques
   - Consider using language-specific quality metrics

4. **Model Fallback Strategy**:
   - Review when model fallbacks are necessary
   - Consider caching fallback decisions for similar text patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive Test Suite**:
   - Update and expand test suite to cover all API endpoints
   - Include performance testing for model fallback scenarios

2. **API Documentation**:
   - Update OpenAPI documentation to reflect all available endpoints
   - Clarify behavior regarding path prefixes

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Add monitoring for translation quality assessments
   - Track frequency of model fallbacks
