# Test Migration Summary

This document explains the process of migrating tests from the root directory to the `tests/` directory.

## Migration Process

1. **Created test directory structure**:
   - `tests/unit/` - For unit tests
   - `tests/unit/models/` - For model-related unit tests
   - `tests/unit/pipeline/` - For pipeline-related unit tests
   - `tests/integration/` - For integration tests
   - `tests/integration/api/` - For API-related integration tests
   - `tests/scripts/` - For shell scripts and test scripts

2. **Created initialization files**:
   - `tests/__init__.py`
   - `tests/unit/__init__.py`
   - `tests/integration/__init__.py`
   - `tests/scripts/__init__.py`

3. **Created common test utilities**:
   - `tests/conftest.py` - Contains common fixtures and utilities for tests

4. **Migrated test files**:
   - 39 Python test files were moved from the root directory to appropriate test directories
   - 36 shell scripts were moved to the `tests/scripts` directory

5. **Checked import paths**:
   - All test files use absolute imports, so no path updates were needed

6. **Created test runner script**:
   - `tests/run_tests.py` - A master script to run tests by type, category, or file

## Test Organization

Tests are now organized by type and category:

1. **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`):
   - `models/` - Tests for model-related functionality
   - `pipeline/` - Tests for pipeline-related functionality
   - Root directory - General unit tests that don't fit a specific category

2. **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`):
   - `api/` - Tests for API endpoints and integrations
   - Root directory - General integration tests

3. **Scripts** (`tests/scripts/`):
   - Shell scripts for testing and demonstrations
   - Other test scripts

## Running Tests

Tests can be run using the master test runner script:

```bash
# Run all tests
python tests/run_tests.py

# Run unit tests only
python tests/run_tests.py --type unit

# Run model-related unit tests
python tests/run_tests.py --type unit --category models

# Run a specific test file
python tests/run_tests.py --file tests/unit/pipeline/test_language_detection.py
```

## Notes and Considerations

1. **Original Files**: The original test files in the root directory have not been deleted. This is to ensure that any scripts or processes that depend on them continue to work during the transition.

2. **Running Location**: Tests should be run from the project root directory, not from inside the tests directory. This is to ensure that modules can be imported correctly.

3. **Import Paths**: All test files use absolute imports (e.g., `from app.core.pipeline.processor import UnifiedProcessor`), which should work regardless of the file location.

4. **Future Work**: Consider updating any scripts or CI/CD pipelines to use the new test locations and test runner script.
