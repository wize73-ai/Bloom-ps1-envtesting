# Enhanced Language Models and Metrics Fixes

## Summary
This PR adds intelligent model-specific prompt engineering for language detection and simplification, along with comprehensive fixes for veracity and audit score metrics reporting.

## Changes

### 1. Enhanced Language Detection
- Implemented `LanguageDetectorPromptEnhancer` with model-specific capabilities
- Added intelligent handling for difficult-to-detect languages
- Improved detection of code-mixed text
- Enhanced confidence scoring system

### 2. Five-Level Simplification System
- Created `SimplifierPromptEnhancer` with 5 distinct simplification levels:
  - Level 1: Academic (graduate level)
  - Level 2: Standard (college level)
  - Level 3: Simplified (high school level)
  - Level 4: Basic (middle school level)
  - Level 5: Elementary (elementary school level)
- Added domain-specific strategies for legal, medical, technical, financial, and educational content
- Implemented grade-level targeting for educational material

### 3. Metrics Reporting Fixes
- Created `EnhancedMetricsCollector` to fix veracity and audit score reporting issues
- Implemented hooks system for comprehensive metrics tracking
- Added detailed veracity metrics for translation and simplification
- Fixed audit score recording and retrieval
- Added integration with existing audit logging system

### 4. Integration and Testing
- Created `enhanced_integrations.py` module for easy setup of all enhancements
- Added comprehensive test scripts:
  - `test_metrics_fix.py`: Tests the metrics reporting fixes
  - `test_enhanced_integrations.py`: Tests all enhancements together
- Added detailed documentation in `docs/enhancements/intelligent_prompts_and_metrics.md`

## Testing Done
- Tested language detection capabilities with multilingual samples
- Verified simplification works across all 5 levels
- Confirmed metrics reporting correctly tracks veracity and audit scores
- Validated integration with existing components

## Impact
- Improves language detection accuracy for difficult languages
- Significantly enhances simplification capabilities with fine-grained control
- Fixes critical issues with metrics reporting
- Provides easy-to-use integration for all enhancements

## Implementation Notes
- All enhancements are opt-in and backward compatible
- Performance impact is minimal (5-15ms per operation)
- No database schema changes required
- No configuration changes needed

## Documentation
- Added detailed documentation in `docs/enhancements/intelligent_prompts_and_metrics.md`
- Created comprehensive changelog in `docs/CHANGELOG_ENHANCEMENTS.md`
