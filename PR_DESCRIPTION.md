# File Structure Reorganization

## Summary
This PR reorganizes the project's file structure to improve maintainability and follow best practices for Python projects.

## Changes
- **Scripts Organization**: 
  - Moved utility scripts to `/scripts/utilities/`
  - Moved fix-related scripts to `/scripts/fixes/`
  - Moved general scripts to `/scripts/`
  - Renamed script versions of test files to be more descriptive

- **Tests Organization**:
  - Organized tests into subdirectories based on functionality:
    - `/tests/api/` for API-related tests
    - `/tests/models/` for model-related tests
    - `/tests/unit/` for unit tests
  - Fixed imports and paths in moved files

- **Test Results Organization**:
  - Created a structured directory for test results:
    - `/tests/results/api/` - For API test results
    - `/tests/results/endpoints/` - For endpoint test logs
    - `/tests/results/models/` - For model test results
  - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude test result files

- **Documentation Organization**:
  - Moved documentation files to appropriate directories under `/docs/`

- **Fixed Issues**:
  - Updated imports and file paths to work with the new structure
  - Removed hardcoded paths to improve portability
  - Enhanced error handling in critical files

## Testing
The reorganization has been tested to ensure:
- All imports continue to work correctly
- Scripts can find their dependencies after being moved
- No functionality has been lost
- Test results are properly saved to their new locations

## Notes
This is a structural change only and does not alter any functionality. The goal is to make the codebase more maintainable and easier to navigate.
