# Verification and Embedding Fixes

This document explains the fixes made to address issues with the verification system and model embedding functionality.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Field Name Mismatch in VerificationResult**:
   - The `VerificationResult` schema expected a field called `translated_text` but the code was using `translation`
   - This caused validation errors in the verification endpoint

2. **Missing `create_embeddings` Method**:
   - The `EnhancedModelManager` was missing a `create_embeddings` method needed by the veracity auditor
   - This caused AttributeError when trying to perform semantic verification

3. **Missing Embedding Model Wrapper**:
   - No wrapper class existed for handling embedding models
   - This led to the error: "Subclasses must implement _preprocess"

4. **Model Registry Configuration**:
   - The model registry needed an entry for "embedding_model" type
   - Without this, the system couldn't locate the correct model for embeddings

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Fixed VerificationResult Schema Mismatch**:
   - Updated `verification.py` to use `translated_text` instead of `translation` to match the schema
   - Fixed both the success case and the fallback error case

2. **Added `create_embeddings` Method to EnhancedModelManager**:
   - Implemented a robust method that can handle various embedding model types
   - Added fallback mechanisms for error cases
   - Added support for both sentence-transformers and regular transformer models

3. **Created EmbeddingModelWrapper Class**:
   - Implemented a dedicated wrapper class for embedding models
   - Added support for different embedding model types and formats
   - Implemented proper pre-processing, inference, and post-processing methods
   - Added robust error handling and fallbacks

4. **Updated Model Registry and Wrapper Map**:
   - Added "embedding_model" to the model registry
   - Updated the wrapper map to use the EmbeddingModelWrapper class for embedding models
   - Ensured the veracity auditor uses the correct model key

## Files Changed

1. **Verification Endpoint**:
   - `/app/api/routes/verification.py` - Updated field names to match schema

2. **Model Manager**:
   - `/app/services/models/manager.py` - Added create_embeddings method
   - `/config/model_registry.json` - Added embedding_model entry

3. **Embedding Wrapper**:
   - `/app/services/models/embedding_wrapper.py` - Created new wrapper class
   - `/app/services/models/wrapper.py` - Updated to import and use EmbeddingModelWrapper

## Testing

The verification system now correctly:
1. Creates embeddings for source and translation texts
2. Performs semantic similarity comparison
3. Returns properly formatted verification results

Future improvements could include:
1. Caching embeddings for frequently used content
2. Using more specialized embedding models for different language pairs
3. Enhancing the semantic verification with additional checks
