# Load Test Summary

Test performed on: Wed May  7 15:25:52 EDT 2025

## Test Scenarios
1. Low load: concurrency=2, translation=10, simplification=10
2. Medium load: concurrency=5, translation=20, simplification=20
3. High load: concurrency=10, translation=50, simplification=50
4. Translation focused: concurrency=8, translation=100, simplification=10
5. Simplification focused: concurrency=8, translation=10, simplification=100

## Next Steps
1. Analyze the results to identify performance bottlenecks
2. Compare throughput and latency across different concurrency levels
3. Check memory usage patterns for potential memory leaks
4. Consider optimizations for the most resource-intensive operations
