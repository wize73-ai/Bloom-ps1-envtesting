# Model Wrapper & Simplification Improvements

This document explains the improvements made to fix issues with the simplification wrapper and model loading.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Simplification Wrapper Issues**:
   - Simplification wrapper was returning "None" instead of properly simplified text
   - `NoneType` object has no attribute 'lower' error when domain is None
   - No proper fallback mechanism when model-based simplification failed
   - Poor error handling for tokenization and model exceptions

2. **Model Loading Issues**:
   - Translation requests were creating new models instead of using already loaded models
   - Model type detection was insufficient for special model types
   - mbart_translation model wasn't being reused properly

3. **Memory Pressure Issues**:
   - Memory pressure metrics were not properly displayed in server tests
   - Missing memory tracking for GPU devices
   - Better memory measurement for model loading and inference

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced SimplifierWrapper

A completely revised SimplifierWrapper implementation that includes:

- Robust rule-based fallback for when model-based simplification fails
- Comprehensive error handling for all stages (tokenization, inference, post-processing)
- Better prompt formatting for different model types
- Clean up of empty results or "None" responses
- Domain-specific handling for legal text

### 2. Improved Model Loading & Caching

- Better model detection in the `create_model_wrapper` function
- Enhanced model reuse in the `run_model` method of `EnhancedModelManager`
- Special handling for MBART models to avoid unnecessary reloading
- Additional logging and metadata for model tracking

### 3. Fixed Memory Pressure Tracking

- Enhanced memory usage tracking in BaseModelWrapper
- Better measurement of memory differences before and after processing
- GPU memory tracking when available
- Enhanced metrics in the model output

## Files Modified

1. `/app/services/models/wrapper.py` - Updated with better implementation of SimplifierWrapper
2. `/app/services/models/manager.py` - Enhanced model loading and caching

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been created to verify these fixes:

- `test_model_wrapper_improvements.py` - Tests simplification, translation, and memory tracking
- `fix_wrapper_issues.sh` - Script to apply and test all fixes

## How to Apply the Fixes

Run the fix script:

```bash
./fix_wrapper_issues.sh
```

This will:
1. Apply all the necessary code changes
2. Run the tests to verify that the changes work correctly
3. Show a summary of the fixes applied

## Results

After applying these fixes:

- Simplification now reliably returns simplified text, even when the model fails
- Translation reuses loaded models for better performance
- Memory metrics are properly tracked and displayed in server tests
- Error handling is more robust for all model operations

These improvements ensure that the application remains stable and provides consistent results, even when faced with model loading or inference issues.
