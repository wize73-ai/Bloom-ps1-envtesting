# Strategy for Fixing and Testing All API Routes

## Testing Approach

1. **Sequential Testing**: Start with the most basic endpoints (health checks) and progressively move to more complex ones.
   
2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Set `CASALINGUA_ENV=development` for authentication bypass
   - Ensure all required models are loaded
   - Verify database connections are working

3. **Dependency Tracking**: For each endpoint, identify its dependencies (models, databases, etc.) and ensure they work first.

4. **Testing Phases**:
   - Phase 1: Connectivity Testing (Can we reach the endpoint?)
   - Phase 2: Authentication Testing (Does auth work correctly?)
   - Phase 3: Functionality Testing (Does it return expected results?)
   - Phase 4: Edge Case Testing (How does it handle invalid inputs?)

5. **Testing Tools**:
   - Create a unified test script with authentication handling
   - Log all failures with specific error details
   - Store test results for comparison

## Fixing Approach

1. **Prioritization**:
   - Core functionality first (health, translation, language detection)
   - Admin endpoints second
   - Experimental features last

2. **Common Issues**:
   - Authentication issues
   - Missing model dependencies
   - Invalid request schemas
   - Incomplete implementations
   - Error handling issues

3. **Fix Categories**:
   - Quick fixes (configuration, typos, wrong params)
   - Medium fixes (logic errors, schema issues)
   - Complex fixes (architectural issues, missing dependencies)

## Test and Fix Workflow

For each endpoint:

1. Run initial test to identify issues
2. Categorize issues found
3. Apply appropriate fixes
4. Re-test to verify fix worked
5. Document fix and test results

## Testing Groups

### Group 1: Core Functionality
- Health endpoints
- Translation endpoints
- Language detection endpoints

### Group 2: Text Processing
- Analyze endpoint
- Simplify endpoint
- Anonymize endpoint
- Summarize endpoint

### Group 3: Admin & Metrics
- System information endpoints
- Models endpoints
- Metrics endpoints
- Authentication endpoints

### Group 4: Advanced Features
- RAG endpoints
- Streaming endpoints
- Bloom Housing compatibility endpoints

## Success Criteria

An endpoint is considered fixed and tested when:

1. It returns a 200 OK status code (or appropriate status code for the operation)
2. It returns a well-formed response according to its schema
3. The response contains the expected data for a test input
4. It handles at least one edge case appropriately
5. Authentication works as expected
