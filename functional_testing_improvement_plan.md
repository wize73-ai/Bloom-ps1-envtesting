# Functional Testing Improvement Plan

Based on our initial test runs, we've identified several areas where our functional testing framework needs improvement. This document outlines a plan to address these issues and enhance the overall quality of our functional test suite.

## 1. Test Resilience Improvements

### 1.1 Endpoint Discovery
- Create a centralized endpoint registry to store information about available endpoints
- Implement an endpoint discovery mechanism that tests multiple endpoint patterns
- Add fallback endpoints for each API feature to accommodate different server configurations

### 1.2 Response Handling
- Implement more flexible response parsing to handle different response formats
- Add support for partial model loading scenarios (e.g., "unknown" language detection)
- Create utility functions to extract data from complex nested responses

### 1.3 Test Skipping Logic
- Implement more granular test skipping logic based on server capabilities
- Add capability detection during test setup to determine which tests can run
- Create a dependency tree for tests to skip dependent tests when prerequisites fail

## 2. Test Environment Management

### 2.1 Server Status Verification
- Implement a more robust server status check that verifies specific capabilities
- Add timeout and retry logic for server components that might be initializing
- Create a server status dashboard that reports which components are available

### 2.2 Test Data Management
- Add more comprehensive test data for each language and feature
- Implement test data versioning to ensure consistency
- Create data generators for edge cases

### 2.3 Configuration Management
- Add support for different server configurations (dev, test, prod)
- Implement configuration overrides for testing specific scenarios
- Create test-specific configurations that bypass certain checks

## 3. Test Coverage Expansion

### 3.1 Additional API Tests
- Add tests for all available API endpoints
- Implement negative testing for each endpoint
- Add performance and load testing capabilities

### 3.2 Component Tests
- Create isolated tests for each pipeline component
- Add mocking capabilities to test components without dependencies
- Implement boundary testing for each component

### 3.3 Integration Tests
- Add more comprehensive workflow tests
- Create tests for complex multi-step processes
- Implement state verification between steps

## 4. Test Reporting Improvements

### 4.1 Enhanced Reporting
- Implement more detailed test result reporting
- Create visual dashboards for test results
- Add trend analysis for test results over time

### 4.2 Failure Analysis
- Implement automatic failure analysis
- Add more detailed error reporting
- Create a failure categorization system

### 4.3 Documentation
- Create comprehensive documentation for the test framework
- Add test usage examples
- Create troubleshooting guides for common test failures

## 5. Continuous Integration Integration

### 5.1 CI Pipeline
- Integrate functional tests into the CI pipeline
- Add automatic test execution on code changes
- Implement test reporting in the CI system

### 5.2 Test Stability
- Monitor test stability over time
- Identify and fix flaky tests
- Implement test quarantine for unstable tests

### 5.3 Test Performance
- Optimize test execution time
- Implement parallel test execution
- Add test profiling to identify slow tests
