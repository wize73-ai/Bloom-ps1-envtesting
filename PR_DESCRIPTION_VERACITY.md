# Complete Veracity Integration for Translation Pipeline

This PR finalizes the integration of our veracity checking system with the CasaLingua translation pipeline. Building on the initial implementation of the VeracityAuditor, this PR ensures full end-to-end verification of translation outputs with proper handling of verification results.

## Summary

- Fully integrate veracity checking in the TranslationModelWrapper
- Add direct support for Spanish to English translation verification
- Implement proper handling of verification results in translation outputs
- Add comprehensive testing for veracity integration

## Details

### Enhanced Integration 

1. **TranslationModelWrapper Enhancements** (`app/services/models/wrapper.py`):
   - Added `_check_veracity` and `_check_veracity_sync` methods for veracity checking
   - Implemented proper handling of veracity data in the processing pipeline
   - Enhanced postprocessing to include veracity metrics in translation results
   - Added graceful fallback for veracity errors

2. **Model Manager Integration** (`app/services/models/manager.py`):
   - Ensured model wrappers automatically receive veracity checker instances
   - Added proper handling of veracity metrics in model outputs
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing API

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Direct test for veracity integration (`test_translation_veracity.py`)
   - End-to-end API tests for translation with verification
   - Mock objects for isolated testing of the veracity system

### Key Improvements

- **Comprehensive Quality Assessment**: All translations now undergo automatic verification
- **Seamless Integration**: Verification happens automatically without additional API calls
- **Transparent Results**: Verification data is included in translation metadata
- **Quality Metrics**: Truth and accuracy scores derived from verification results
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallbacks ensure system stability even if verification fails

### How Verification Works

1. When a translation is processed, the wrapper automatically calls the veracity checker
2. The veracity system performs multiple checks:
   - Basic validation (empty content, untranslated text)
   - Semantic verification (meaning preservation)
   - Content integrity (numbers, entities, formatting)
3. Verification results are attached to the translation output
4. Quality metrics are updated based on verification scores

The verification is particularly valuable for:
- Detecting mistranslations and missing content
- Ensuring translations preserve the original meaning
- Identifying potentially problematic translations
- Providing objective quality measurements

## Testing Done

- Direct testing of the TranslationModelWrapper with veracity integration
- Testing with Spanish to English translations (previously problematic)
- Verification of proper metadata inclusion in translation outputs
- Handling of edge cases and error conditions

## Next Steps

- Create a veracity audit dashboard to monitor translation quality over time
- Expand verification support for domain-specific translations (legal, medical)
- Implement more language-specific verification rules
- Add reference-based verification for key language pairs
