# Translation Model Quality Assessment

## Overview

This document summarizes our findings regarding the translation quality of the upgraded models in the CasaLingua system. We've run several tests to compare the performance of the MT5-base and MBART-large-50 models.

## Key Findings

1. **MBART Significantly Outperforms MT5**: Despite upgrading from MT5-small to MT5-base, the MBART model consistently produces far superior translations across all test cases.

2. **MT5 Quality Issues**: The MT5 model, even after upgrading to the larger base variant, continues to produce incomplete or low-quality translations. Examples:
   - `"The quick brown fox :"` (incomplete)
   - `"fr: The new machine learning. ."` (repetition of source text with minimal modification)
   - `"translate de: :"` (empty translation with formatting artifacts)

3. **MBART Strengths**: The MBART model demonstrates excellent translation quality, preserving meaning and style across multiple language pairs:
   - English to Spanish: Clean and accurate translations
   - English to French: Proper handling of technical content
   - English to German: Good preservation of meaning in complex sentences
   - English to Italian: Excellent handling of figurative language

4. **Performance Considerations**: MBART is slower than MT5 (average 1.66s vs 0.62s per translation), but the quality difference makes this trade-off worthwhile.

## Recommendations

Based on these findings, we recommend the following changes:

1. **Prioritize MBART for Primary Translation**: Configure the system to use MBART as the default translation model due to its superior quality.

2. **MT5 as Fallback Only**: Keep MT5-base as a fallback option only for cases where MBART might not be available or for language pairs not supported by MBART.

3. **Update API Documentation**: Update documentation to highlight the improved translation quality from using MBART as the primary translation model.

4. **End-to-End Testing**: Before deploying to production, run end-to-end tests with MBART as the primary model to ensure all API endpoints function correctly with the new configuration.
